# First steps with the Sipeed Longan Nano

This repo will have notes and code from my first experiments building code for
the Longan, a RISC-V-based dev board, and what tools I need along the way. I'm
aiming to work outside of PlatformIO, which already has support for this board,
because I don't want to be stuck in their ecosystem.
